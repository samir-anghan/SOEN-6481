\section{Introduction}

This document is a part of project report on the problem domain model Calculator System. Domain is a calculator that computes the value of certain established irrational numbers. The purpose of the project is to carry out a number of activities, resulting in a set of interrelated artifacts for the problem domain of such a calculator.\\ \\
In this document, the user stories for calculator system has been described. Each user story is associated with a priority, estimate (in story points), as well as with one or more acceptance tests. The document also describes backward traceability matrix for each user story. In the last, it also provides information on the Java implementations of the selected representative user stories.
